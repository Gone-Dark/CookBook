- For Performance different categories of Unicode are placed in separate
		  `.txt` files.
- Larger selection of Characters and Symbols.
- `‚èé` button to send user back to menu without having to reload Script.
- Easily add more Files and Unicode without having to touch the code itself.
		
### Adding To Collection
***Scripts*** ‚Ü¥
- To add more Script type retrieve the chart from source
- open `Scripts.txt`. on the first available empty line and paste unicode.

*For seamless Use, change Script file name to `Special Characters.py` and
place inside `Examples/Keyboard/` replacing original script. This way will use 
new Version instead without the need to Setup inside Pythonista settings.*

### Adding `.txt` files
- place new file inside Locak Directory and add to new line the `file name` inside `Options.txt`
- new file will be available in home menu on next launch.
