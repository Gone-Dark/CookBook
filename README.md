### Game Development
* Space Escape [⟿](https://github.com/StephenFrey/CookBook/blob/master/Pythonista/GameDevelopment/SPACE%20ESCAPE/space_ecape.py)
  - Game writing to help others get started using Pythonista's `scene` module.
  - Code is written use different styles of implementing aspects of the game to show flexibility of game deign. 
  - All images are Pythonista Built-in so the user can focus on the code instead of getting anything imported.
  - the game itself has a few bugs and are due to using different styles in one script the way i have. they are easy to fix but doing so effects the purpose so i left them.
  - i may add to this in the future but nothing set in stone. i did want o have menus, character creation, sound and multiple levels but was pressed on time from self set goals

  
 * TickManager.py
    - Simple clasd to provide updating to any class
